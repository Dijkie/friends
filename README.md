# Friends for WordPress

**Connect WordPresses through friendships and RSS**

With the Friends plugin, you can add friends to your WordPress site. It will add a private `/friends/` page that holds a feed of your friends' posts.

A friendship is established between WordPress sites after a friend request is accepted.

The feed of friendsâ€™ posts might be nice already but things get interesting when your friends write private posts.

While the private posts remain invisible to random visitors of their sites, they appear on your `/friends/` page.

On each WordPress the the public and private posts of the respective friends can be seen.

The Friends plugin is compatible with the WordPress mobile apps, so you can also post privately from them.

You can send a friendship request to another WordPress that has this plugin installed. As soon as the friendship is established you can see the private posts on the other WordPress, pulled over using RSS feeds.
