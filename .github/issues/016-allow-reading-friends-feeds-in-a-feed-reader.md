We can do this by providing a download for a OPML file.

Perhaps better than allowing simply the download of an OPML file, it would be nice to have the ability to provide a link to an OPML file as well? This way feed readers like Inoreader that support [OPML subscription](https://blog.inoreader.com/2014/05/opml-subscriptions.html) would be able to auto update themselves when new feeds/friends are added to the list?

Depending on your infrastructure, you could potentially leverage the old [Link Manager](https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Manager) within WordPress which provided OPML outputs as well as [outputs arranged by category](https://boffosocko.com/2017/11/13/opml-files-for-categories-within-wordpresss-links-manager/#OPML%20files%20by%20category). This would prevent you from needing to rebuild the side-files unless youâ€™re doing that already.
