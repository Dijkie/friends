If you want to form more flexible blogs around topics for friends (like Facebook private groups), this could be achieved with adding a new friend role:
- "Friend Poster:" a friend that can post on a blog, i.e. post to all friends of a blog.

To make someone the admin equivalent of a Facebook Group, you can simple assign a friend an admin role of the blog.
